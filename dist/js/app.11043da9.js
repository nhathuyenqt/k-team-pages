The system can be very simple in its architecture, yet extremely powerful in its functionality. This project shall study the architecture and data analytics for such a system and focus on: (i) employing statistical methods and machine learning techniques to the collected data to extract its medical meaning; (ii) investigate efficient and privacy-preserving: authentication protocols and verifiable outsourcing/delegation of computations to the cloud.

A successful implementation of this internet-of-things (IoT) vision calls for a wireless communication system that: (i) is able to support a much larger number of connected devices, (ii) is able to fulfil much more stringent requirements on latency and reliability, and (iii) offers more sophisticated privacy-preserving authentication and security mechanisms. The introduction of future services based on machine-type communication, such as intelligent transportation, augmented reality, remote health care, smart metering, and industrial automation heavily rely on the availability of such a wireless communication system.

In many cases, this crucially depends on accurate and reliable authentication. We need to get authenticated in order to get access to restricted services and/or places. The  overall goal of the project is to develop  privacy-preserving authentication mechanisms for  noisy,  constrained and hostile environments that strike an optimal balance of reliable (accurate) authentication, privacy-preservation and resource consumption. Authentication is especially challenging when it appears under  constrained settings due to: (i)  privacy issues, (ii)  noisy conditions, and (iii)  resource limits. Privacy-preservation is essential for the protection of sensitive information (i.e. diseases, location, nationality). Noisy conditions refer to physical noise in the communication channel that may lead to modification of the transmitted information, or natural variability due to the authentication medium (e.g. fingerprint scans). Resource constraints refer to limited device power/abilities (i.e. sensors, RFID tags).

Cross-layer protocol design could solve important security challenges in ad-hoc wireless environments that cannot effectively be solved only with conventional cryptography, such as relay-resistant authentication. Cross-layer security protocol design has the potential to bring about benefits in wireless networks where computational and power resources are constrained, or where communication needs to be made robust for purposes of reliability and fault tolerance.

In wireless ad hoc networks, the malicious status of nodes is uncertain. The second goal was to respond to suspected intrusions in a way that optimally balances the promptness of warnings, the reliability of decisions and the network performance. The third goal was to extend intrusion detection and response mechanisms to the adversarial case: i.e. the case where the attacker is behaving in a rational manner in order to more effectively evade it. Recent advances in this area make this a particularly interesting avenue of investigation. Our research focused on making such algorithms practical and evaluating them in various traffic conditions and types of attacks.

This articlead-dresses the question whether it is possible to homomorphically compute arbitrary functions on signcrypted data.Theanswer is affirmative and a newcryptographicprimitive, homomorphic signcryption(HSC) with public plain text‐result checkability is proposed that allows both to evaluate arbitrary functions over signcrypted data and makesit possiblefor anyone to publiclytest whethera given ciphertext is the signcryption of the message underthe key. Two notions of message privacy are also investigated: weak message privacy and message privacy depending on whether the original signcryptions used in the evaluation are disclosed or not. More precisely, the contributions are two‐fold:(i) two different definitions of HSC with public plaintext‐result check ability  is providedfor arbitrary functionsin terms of syntax,unforgeabilityand messageprivacy dependingon if the homomorphic computationis performedin a private or in a publicevaluationsetting,(ii) two HSCconstructions are proposed:one for a public evaluation setting and anotherfor a private evaluation setting and securityis formally proved."},{"name":"Statically Aggregate Verifiable Random Functions and Application to E-Lottery.","paperLink":"https://www.cse.chalmers.se/~aikmitr/papers/crypto-MDPI2020-LBM.pdf","authors":"B.

In this paper, we explore the aggregation augmentation on verifiable random function (VRFs), introduced by Micali, Rabin and Vadhan (FOCS’99), as well as its application to e-lottery schemes. We introduce the notion of static aggregate verifiable random functions (Agg-VRFs), which perform aggregation for VRFs in a static setting. Our contributions can be summarized as follows: (1) we define static aggregate VRFs, which allow the efficient aggregation of VRF values and the corresponding proofs over super-polynomially large sets; (2) we present a static Agg-VRF construction over bit-fixing sets with respect to product aggregation based on the q-decisional Diffie–Hellman exponent assumption; (3) we test the performance of our static Agg-VRFs instantiation in comparison to a standard (non-aggregate) VRF in terms of costing time for the aggregation and verification processes, which shows that Agg-VRFs lower considerably the timing of verification of      big sets; and (4) by employing Agg-VRFs, we propose an improved e-lottery scheme based on the framework of Chow et al.’s VRF-based e-lottery proposal (ICCSA’05).

These computations often rely on the        aggregation of data collected from multiple clients, while the clients want to guarantee that the results are correct and, thus, an output that can be publicly verified is required. However, important security and privacy challenges are raised, since clients may hold sensitive information. In this paper, we propose an approach, called verifiable additive homomorphic secret sharing (VAHSS), to achieve practical and provably secure aggregation of data, while allowing for the clients to protect their secret data and providing public verifiability i.e., everyone should be able to verify the correctness of the computed result. We propose three VAHSS constructions by combining an additive homomorphic secret sharing (HSS) scheme, for computing the sum of the clients’ secret inputs, and three different methods for achieving public verifiability, namely: (i) homomorphic collision-resistant hash functions; (ii) linear homomorphic signatures; as well as (iii) a threshold RSA signature scheme. In all three constructions, we provide a detailed correctness, security, and verifiability analysis and detailed experimental evaluations. Our results demonstrate the efficiency of our proposed constructions, especially from the client side."},{"name":"Multi-key homomorphic authenticators.

Motivated by realistic scenarios in which large datasets include data provided by multiple users, we study the concept of multi-key homomorphic authenticators.

In this paper, we introduce and formally define multi-key HAs.

Digital signatures can provide important integrity guarantees to prevent illegal users from getting access to private and sensitive data in various IoT applications. Functional signatures, introduced by Boyle, Goldwasser and Ivan (PKC 2014) as signatures with a finegrained access control, allow an authority to generate signing keys corresponding to various functions such that a user with a signing key for a function f , can sign the image of the function f on a message m i.e., can sign f (m). Okamoto and Takashima (PKC 2013) firstly proposed the notion of a decentralized multi-authority functional signature (DMA-FS) scheme, which supports non-monotone access structures combined with inner-product relations. In this paper, we generalise the definition of DMA-FS proposed by Okamoto et al. (PKC13) for even more general policy functions, which support any polynomial-size boolean predicates other than the inner product relation and allow modifications of the original message. In our multi-authority functional signature (MAFS), there are multiple authorities and each one is able to certify a specific function and issue a corresponding functional signing key for each individual with some property, rendering them very useful in application settings such smart homes, smart cities, smart health care etc. We also provide a general transformation from a standard signature scheme to a MAFS scheme.

In these environment secure, ad-hoc device-to-device interaction is important, but offers a challenge because devices might belong to different systems, or security domains, which complicates trusted communication and key establishment. There has been a growing interest in complementing conventional cryptography with physical context.This allows for services that are difficult to achieve with existing cryptographic mechanisms: devices pairing (initial key establishment) and proof-of-proximity (ensuring devices are physically present). Numerous methods, the majority of which are based on the physical context of device characteristics, behavior or environment, have been proposed to supplement cryptography in achieving these services. This paper provides an overview of this area of research, first discussing the nature and importance of the two specified security services in ad-hoc communication settings and then providing an introduction to prominent physical context security approaches in literature."},{"name":"VIVO: A secure, privacy-preserving, and real-time crowd-sensing framework for the Internet of Things","paperLink":"https://eprints.bournemouth.ac.uk/31245/1/vivo-secure-privacy.pdf","authors":"L.

Distance-bounding (DB) protocols are cross-layer authentication protocols that are based on the round-trip-time of challenge-response exchanges and can be employed to guarantee physical proximity and combat relay attacks. However, traditional DB protocols rely on the assumption that the prover (e.g., user) is in the communication range of the verifier (e.g., access point); something that might not be the case in multiple access control scenarios in ubiquitous computing environments as well as when we need to verify the proximity of our two-hop neighbour in an ad-hoc network. In this paper, we extend traditional DB protocols to a two-hop setting i.e. when the prover is out of the communication range of the verifier and thus, they both need to rely on an untrusted in-between entity in order to verify proximity. We present a formal framework that captures the most representative classes of existing DB protocols and provide a general method to extend traditional DB protocols to the two-hop case (three participants). We analyse the security of two-hop DB protocols and identify connections with the security issues of the corresponding one-hop case. Finally, we demonstrate the correctness of our security analysis and the efficiency of our model by transforming five existing DB protocols to the two-hop setting and we evaluate their performance with simulated experiments."},{"name":"HB+DB: Distance bounding meets human based authentication.","paperLink":"https://www.cse.chalmers.se/~aikmitr/papers/HBDBjournal.pdf","authors":"E.

Can Bayesian inference be used directly to provide private access to data? The answer is yes: under certain conditions on the prior, sampling from the posterior distribution can lead to a desired level of privacy and utility. For a uniform treatment, we define differential privacy over arbitrary data set metrics, outcome spaces and distribution families. This allows us to also deal with non-i.i.d or non-tabular data sets. We then prove bounds on the sensitivity of the posterior to the data, which delivers a measure of robustness. We also show how to use posterior sampling to provide differentially private responses to queries, within a decision-theoretic framework. Finally, we provide bounds on the utility of answers to queries and on the ability of an adversary to distinguish between data sets. The latter are complemented by a novel use of Le Cam’s method to obtain lower bounds on distinguishability. Our results hold for arbitrary metrics, including those for the common definition of differential privacy.

When agents are honest, the system functions well and there is a net profit. Unfortunately, some agents may be malicious, but it may be hard to detect them. We consider the decision making problem of how to permanently blacklist agents, in order to maximise expected profit. The problem of efficiently deciding which nodes to permanently blacklist has various applications ranging from efficient intrusion response, network management, shutting down malware infected hosts in an internal network and efficient distribution of services in a network. In this paper, we propose an approach to efficiently perform this blacklisting while minimising the cost of the service provider. Although our approach is quite general and could be applied to all the previously mentioned applications, to ease understanding we consider the problem in which an Internet service provider (ISP) needs to decide whether or not to blacklist a possibly misbehaving node.This is not trivial, as blacklisting may erroneously expel honest nodes (agents). Conversely, while we gain information by allowing a node to remain, we may incur a cost due to malicious behaviour. We present an efficient algorithm (HIPER) for making nearoptimal decisions for this problem. Additionally, we derive three algorithms by reducing the problem to a Markov decision process (MDP). Theoretically, we show that HIPER is nearoptimal. Experimentally, its performance is close to that of the full MDP solution, when the (stronger) requirements of the latter are met."},{"name":"Grouping-Proof-Distance-Bounding Protocols: Keep all your friends close.","paperLink":"https://www.cse.chalmers.se/~aikmitr/papers/GPDB.pdf","authors":"C.

Furthermore, important features of each attack and defense system category are described and advantages and disadvantages of each proposed scheme are outlined. The goal of the paper is to place some order into the existing attack and defense mechanisms, so that a better understanding of DDoS attacks can be achieved and subsequently more efficient and effective algorithms, techniques and procedures to combat these attacks may be developed."}]')},"646a":function(e){e.exports=JSON.parse('[{"sm":"SS 2022","title":"Privacy-Preserving Cryptographic Protocols","link":"https://courses.unisg.ch/event/events/by-term/b987f42f-0c9b-41b2-b8af-97844b0e939d/12427923"},{"sm":"SS 2022","title":"Cryptography","link":"https://courses.unisg.ch/event/events/by-term/b987f42f-0c9b-41b2-b8af-97844b0e939d/12427905"},{"sm":"AS2022","title":"Security & Privacy in Cloud-Assisted Computing","link":"https://courses.unisg.ch/event/events/by-term/67780ec0-88e3-4095-a998-2dbf77921493/12425662"},{"sm":"AS2022","title":"Cybersecurity and Privacy","link":"https://courses.unisg.ch/event/events/by-term/67780ec0-88e3-4095-a998-2dbf77921493/12425808"},{"sm":"AS2022","title":"Data Security and Privacy","link":"https://courses.unisg.ch/event/events/by-term/67780ec0-88e3-4095-a998-2dbf77921493/12426034"},{"sm":"AS2022","title":"Cyber Security","link":"https://courses.unisg.ch/event/events/by-term/67780ec0-88e3-4095-a998-2dbf77921493/12425761"}]')},6847:function(e,t,i){e.exports=i.p+"img/Nan.93326bd3.jpeg"},7319:function(e,t,i){},"7a59":function(e,t,i){e.exports=i.p+"img/FIoT.1b90f7f7.jpeg"},"7cdf":function(e,t,i){e.exports=i.p+"img/Biometrics.c37d6b2d.jpeg"},"7fb3":function(e,t,i){e.exports=i.p+"img/sssProject.1e8948ff.jpeg"},"8cb1":function(e,t,i){e.exports=i.p+"img/Georgia.1851d31f.jpeg"},"8ea6":function(e,t,i){e.exports=i.p+"img/PPIDR.dfbca80e.jpeg"},"9bc8":function(e,t,i){},"9ce9":function(e,t,i){e.exports=i.p+"img/evoz.cdafc8f6.jpg"},"9f44":function(e,t,i){e.exports=i.p+"img/Jenit.4765859e.jpeg"},ab45:function(e,t,i){e.exports=i.p+"img/5Gdiagram.341d41c6.png"},ac99:function(e){e.exports=JSON.parse('[{"fullname":"Katerina Mitrokotsa","name":"Katerina","position":"Full Professor in Cyber Security","websiteLink":"https://www.cse.chalmers.se/~aikmitr/"},{"fullname":"Eriane Breu","name":"Eriane","position":"Administration"},{"fullname":"Hiraku Morita","name":"Hiraku","position":"Postdoctoral Researcher"},{"fullname":"Sayantan Mukherjee","name":"Say","position":"Postdoctoral Researcher"},{"fullname":"Johannes Ernst","name":"Johannes","position":"Doctoral Researcher"},{"fullname":"Adrien Pasquereau","name":"Adrien","position":"Doctoral Researcher"},{"fullname":"Georgia Tsaloli","name":"Georgia","position":"Doctoral Researcher"},{"fullname":"Uddipana Dowerah","name":"Uddi","position":"Doctoral Researcher"},{"fullname":"Nan Cheng","name":"Nan","position":"Doctoral Researcher"},{"fullname":"Jenit Tomy","name":"Jenit","position":"Doctoral Researcher"},{"fullname":"Tran Ngoc Nhat Huyen","name":"Huyen","position":"Cryptography Engineer"}]')},acb9:function(e,t,i){e.exports=i.p+"img/twohop.7a4a11f9.jpeg"},adf4:function(e,t,i){},b11e:function(e,t,i){var a={"./5Gdiagram.png":"ab45","./Biometrics.jpeg":"7cdf","./CloudComp2.jpeg":"d773","./Cryptanalysis.jpeg":"5bb2","./FIoT.jpeg":"7a59","./PPIDR.jpeg":"8ea6","./automatedLab.jpeg":"baed","./constrained.jpeg":"154d","./evoz.jpg":"9ce9","./sssProject.jpeg":"7fb3","./twohop.jpeg":"acb9"};function n(e){var t=o(e);return i(t)}function o(e){if(!i.o(a,e)){var t=new Error("Cannot find module '"+e+"'");throw t.code="MODULE_NOT_FOUND",t}return a[e]}n.keys=function(){return Object.keys(a)},n.resolve=o,e.exports=n,n.id="b11e"},b6bf:function(e,t,i){},b79f:function(e,t,i){"use strict";i("7319")},baed:function(e,t,i){e.exports=i.p+"img/automatedLab.297c2324.jpeg"},c09c:function(e,t,i){"use strict";i("adf4")},c715:function(e,t,i){e.exports=i.p+"img/Katerina.16878c2b.jpeg"},d27b:function(e,t,i){e.exports=i.p+"img/Uddi.f5929f41.jpeg"},d58c:function(e,t,i){e.exports=i.p+"img/privacy.f98948ae.jpeg"},d773:function(e,t,i){e.exports=i.p+"img/CloudComp2.6e8d37d8.jpeg"},d80e:function(e,t,i){e.exports=i.p+"img/Say.e98ba60f.jpeg"},e443:function(e,t,i){e.exports=i.p+"img/Johannes.02b06562.jpeg"},ed1d:function(e){e.exports=JSON.parse('[{"_id":"61dc513902651d2c0cdd5226","Title":"DDoS Attacks and Defense Mechanisms: A Classification","Authors":"A.
