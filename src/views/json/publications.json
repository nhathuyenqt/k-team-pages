    "abstract": "Signcrypti onoriginally proposed by Zheng(CRYPTO097) is a useful cryptographic primitive that provides strong confidentiality and integrity guarantees. This articlead-dresses the question whether it is possible to homomorphically compute arbitrary functions on signcrypted data.Theanswer is affirmative and a newcryptographicprimitive, homomorphic signcryption(HSC) with public plain text‐result checkability is proposed that allows both to evaluate arbitrary functions over signcrypted data and makesit possiblefor anyone to publiclytest whethera given ciphertext is the signcryption of the message underthe key. Two notions of message privacy are also investigated: weak message privacy and message privacy depending on whether the original signcryptions used in the evaluation are disclosed or not. More precisely, the contributions are two‐fold:(i) two different definitions of HSC with public plaintext‐result check ability  is providedfor arbitrary functionsin terms of syntax,unforgeabilityand messageprivacy dependingon if the homomorphic computationis performedin a private or in a publicevaluationsetting,(ii) two HSCconstructions are proposed:one for a public evaluation setting and anotherfor a private evaluation setting and securityis formally proved."

In this paper, we explore the aggregation augmentation on verifiable random function (VRFs), introduced by Micali, Rabin and Vadhan (FOCS’99), as well as its application to e-lottery schemes. We introduce the notion of static aggregate verifiable random functions (Agg-VRFs), which perform aggregation for VRFs in a static setting. Our contributions can be summarized as follows: (1) we define static aggregate VRFs, which allow the efficient aggregation of VRF values and the corresponding proofs over super-polynomially large sets; (2) we present a static Agg-VRF construction over bit-fixing sets with respect to product aggregation based on the q-decisional Diffie–Hellman exponent assumption; (3) we test the performance of our static Agg-VRFs instantiation in comparison to a standard (non-aggregate) VRF in terms of costing time for the aggregation and verification processes, which shows that Agg-VRFs lower considerably the timing of verification of      big sets; and (4) by employing Agg-VRFs, we propose an improved e-lottery scheme based on the framework of Chow et al.’s VRF-based e-lottery proposal (ICCSA’05). We evaluate the performance of Chow et al.’s e-lottery scheme and our improved scheme, and the latter shows a significant improvement in the efficiency of generating the winning number and the player verification."

    "abstract": "Often clients (e.g., sensors, organizations) need to outsource joint computations that are based on some joint inputs to external untrusted servers. These computations often rely on the        aggregation of data collected from multiple clients, while the clients want to guarantee that the results are correct and, thus, an output that can be publicly verified is required. However, important security and privacy challenges are raised, since clients may hold sensitive information. In this paper, we propose an approach, called verifiable additive homomorphic secret sharing (VAHSS), to achieve practical and provably secure aggregation of data, while allowing for the clients to protect their secret data and providing public verifiability i.e., everyone should be able to verify the correctness of the computed result. We propose three VAHSS constructions by combining an additive homomorphic secret sharing (HSS) scheme, for computing the sum of the clients’ secret inputs, and three different methods for achieving public verifiability, namely: (i) homomorphic collision-resistant hash functions; (ii) linear homomorphic signatures; as well as (iii) a threshold RSA signature scheme. In all three constructions, we provide a detailed correctness, security, and verifiability analysis and detailed experimental evaluations. Our results demonstrate the efficiency of our proposed constructions, especially from the client side."

    "abstract": "Homomorphic authenticators (HAs) enable a client to authenticate a large collection of data elements m1, …, mt and outsource them, along with the corresponding authenticators, to an untrusted server. At any later point, the server can generate a short authenticator σf phi_f_y, vouching for the correctness of the output y of a function f computed on the outsourced data, i.e. y = f(m1, …, mt). The notion of HAs studied so far, however, only supports executions of computations over data authenticated by     a single user. Motivated by realistic scenarios in which large datasets include data provided by multiple users, we study the concept of multi-key homomorphic authenticators. In a nutshell, multi-key HAs are like HAs with the extra feature of allowing the holder of public evaluation keys to compute on data authenticated under different secret keys. In this paper, we introduce and formally define multi-key HAs. Secondly, we propose a construction of a multi-key homomorphic signature based on standard lattices and supporting the evaluation of circuits of bounded polynomial depth. Thirdly, we provide a construction of multi-key homomorphic MACs based only on pseudorandom functions and supporting the evaluation of low-degree arithmetic circuits."

    "abstract": "With the rapid development of the Internet of Things (IoT) a lot of critical information is shared however without having guarantees about the origin and integrity of the information. Digital signatures can provide important integrity guarantees to prevent illegal users from getting access to private and sensitive data in various IoT applications. Functional signatures, introduced by Boyle, Goldwasser and Ivan (PKC 2014) as signatures with a finegrained access control, allow an authority to generate signing keys corresponding to various functions such that a user with a signing key for a function f , can sign the image of the function f on a message m i.e., can sign f (m). Okamoto and Takashima (PKC 2013) firstly proposed the notion of a decentralized multi-authority functional signature (DMA-FS) scheme, which supports non-monotone access structures combined with inner-product relations. In this paper, we generalise the definition of DMA-FS proposed by Okamoto et al. (PKC13) for even more general policy functions, which support any polynomial-size boolean predicates other than the inner product relation and allow modifications of the original message. In our multi-authority functional signature (MAFS), there are multiple authorities and each one is able to certify a specific function and issue a corresponding functional signing key for each individual with some property, rendering them very useful in application settings such smart homes, smart cities, smart health care etc. We also provide a general transformation from a standard signature scheme to a MAFS scheme. Moreover, we present a way to build a function private MAFS from a FS without function privacy together with SNARKs."

In such application scenarios, a user is often required to prove non-interactively the correct computation of a pseudo-random function Fk(x) without revealing the secret key k used. Commitment schemes are also useful in application settings requiring to commit to a chosen but secret value that could be revealed later. In this short paper, we provide our insights on constructing a lattice-based simulatable verifiable random function (sVRF) using non interactive zero knowledge arguments and dual-mode commitment schemes and we point out the main challenges that need to be addressed in order to achieve it."

It is especially of interest for Internet-of-Things and Cyber-Physical Systems where embedded endpoints make up the edge of the network, and where these devices need to make localised, time-critical decisions. In these environment secure, ad-hoc device-to-device interaction is important, but offers a challenge because devices might belong to different systems, or security domains, which complicates trusted communication and key establishment. There has been a growing interest in complementing conventional cryptography with physical context.This allows for services that are difficult to achieve with existing cryptographic mechanisms: devices pairing (initial key establishment) and proof-of-proximity (ensuring devices are physically present). Numerous methods, the majority of which are based on the physical context of device characteristics, behavior or environment, have been proposed to supplement cryptography in achieving these services. This paper provides an overview of this area of research, first discussing the nature and importance of the two specified security services in ad-hoc communication settings and then providing an introduction to prominent physical context security approaches in literature."

The collected data can be accessed both at the end of the experiment, as in traditional testbeds, as well as in real-time, as required by many Big Data applications. We present here the VIVO architecture, highlighting its advantages over existing solutions, and four relevant real-world applications running on top of VIVO."

    "abstract": "Authentication in wireless communications often depends on the physical proximity to a location. Distance-bounding (DB) protocols are cross-layer authentication protocols that are based on the round-trip-time of challenge-response exchanges and can be employed to guarantee physical proximity and combat relay attacks. However, traditional DB protocols rely on the assumption that the prover (e.g., user) is in the communication range of the verifier (e.g., access point); something that might not be the case in multiple access control scenarios in ubiquitous computing environments as well as when we need to verify the proximity of our two-hop neighbour in an ad-hoc network. In this paper, we extend traditional DB protocols to a two-hop setting i.e. when the prover is out of the communication range of the verifier and thus, they both need to rely on an untrusted in-between entity in order to verify proximity. We present a formal framework that captures the most representative classes of existing DB protocols and provide a general method to extend traditional DB protocols to the two-hop case (three participants). We analyse the security of two-hop DB protocols and identify connections with the security issues of the corresponding one-hop case. Finally, we demonstrate the correctness of our security analysis and the efficiency of our model by transforming five existing DB protocols to the two-hop setting and we evaluate their performance with simulated experiments."

We propose a leading-edge solution to enhance inpatient medication safety based on RFID technology that overcomes these weaknesses. Our solution, named Inpatient Safety RFID system (IS-RFID), takes into account the Information Technology (IT) infrastructure of a hospital and covers every phase of the drug administration process. From a practical perspective, our system can be easily integrated within hospital IT infrastructures, has a moderate cost, is very ease to use and deals with security aspects as a key point."

Biometric credentials are becoming increasingly popular as a means of authenticating people due to the wide range of advantages that they provide with respect to classical authentication methods (e.g., password-based authentication). The most characteristic feature of this authentication method is the naturally strong bond between a user and her biometric credentials. This very same advantageous property, however, raises serious security and privacy concerns in case the biometric trait gets compromised. In this article, we present the most challenging issues that need to be taken into consideration when designing secure and privacypreserving biometric authentication protocols. More precisely, we describe the main threats against privacy-preserving biometric authentication systems and give directions on possible countermeasures in order to design secure and privacy-preserving biometric authentication protocols."

    "abstract": "Differential privacy formalises privacy-preserving mechanisms that provide access to a database. Can Bayesian inference be used directly to provide private access to data? The answer is yes: under certain conditions on the prior, sampling from the posterior distribution can lead to a desired level of privacy and utility. For a uniform treatment, we define differential privacy over arbitrary data set metrics, outcome spaces and distribution families. This allows us to also deal with non-i.i.d or non-tabular data sets. We then prove bounds on the sensitivity of the posterior to the data, which delivers a measure of robustness. We also show how to use posterior sampling to provide differentially private responses to queries, within a decision-theoretic framework. Finally, we provide bounds on the utility of answers to queries and on the ability of an adversary to distinguish between data sets. The latter are complemented by a novel use of Le Cam’s method to obtain lower bounds on distinguishability. Our results hold for arbitrary metrics, including those for the common definition of differential privacy. For specific choices of the metric, we give a number of examples satisfying our assumptions"

    "abstract": "Many applications involve agents sharing a resource, such as networks or services. When agents are honest, the system functions well and there is a net profit. Unfortunately, some agents may be malicious, but it may be hard to detect them. We consider the decision making problem of how to permanently blacklist agents, in order to maximise expected profit. The problem of efficiently deciding which nodes to permanently blacklist has various applications ranging from efficient intrusion response, network management, shutting down malware infected hosts in an internal network and efficient distribution of services in a network. In this paper, we propose an approach to efficiently perform this blacklisting while minimising the cost of the service provider. Although our approach is quite general and could be applied to all the previously mentioned applications, to ease understanding we consider the problem in which an Internet service provider (ISP) needs to decide whether or not to blacklist a possibly misbehaving node.This is not trivial, as blacklisting may erroneously expel honest nodes (agents). Conversely, while we gain information by allowing a node to remain, we may incur a cost due to malicious behaviour. We present an efficient algorithm (HIPER) for making nearoptimal decisions for this problem. Additionally, we derive three algorithms by reducing the problem to a Markov decision process (MDP). Theoretically, we show that HIPER is nearoptimal. Experimentally, its performance is close to that of the full MDP solution, when the (stronger) requirements of the latter are met."

Although distance-bounding (DB) protocols provide a reliable way to prove the physical proximity of a device and grouping-proof (GP) protocols can be employed to prove the presence of multiple provers, proving that multiple devices are present and in close proximity to a verifier is more challenging. In this letter, we introduce a new concept that extends traditional DB protocols to a multi-prover setting and we propose the first GPDB protocol that provides not only a proof of the presence of multiple provers at the same time but also assurance regarding the physical proximity of the provers, requiring limited computational effort.

These security faults refer to impersonation and replay attacks that could produce the generation of a forged proof stating that certain medication was administered to an inpatient when it was not. We propose a leading-edge solution to enhance inpatient medication safety based on RFID technology that overcomes these weaknesses. Our solution, named Inpatient Safety RFID system (IS-RFID), takes into account the Information Technology (IT) infrastructure of a hospital and covers every phase of the drug administration process. From a practical perspective, our system can be easily integrated within hospital IT infrastructures, has a moderate cost, is very ease to use and deals with security aspects as a key point."

Reid et al. proposed the rst symmetric key distance bounding protocol against maa and terrorist fraud attacks [1]. However, [2] claims that this is only achieved with a probability of success for maa fraud, rather than the theoretical value of (for rounds) achieved by distance bounding protocols without a nal signature. We prove that the maa fraud attack success using the Reid et al. protocol is bounded by and reduces as noise increases. The proof can be of further interest as it is the rst–to the best of our knowledge –detailed analysis of the effects of communication errors on the security of a distance bounding protocol."

An efficient intrusion detection approach combined with an authenticated intrusion response can act as an effective line of defense in ad hoc networks. In this paper, we present an intrusion detection engine based on neural networks and an authenticated intrusion response engine based on an innovative key agreement protocol. In particular, we exploit information visualization and machine learning techniques in order to achieve efficient intrusion detection and we propose an effective intrusion response engine that is based on secure communication principles in order to mitigate the impacts of possible attacks. The performance of the proposed model is evaluated under different traffic conditions and mobility patterns. "

Among their advantages is included their low cost and their broad applicability. However, they also present a number of inherent vulnerabilities. This paper develops a structural methodology for risks that RFID networks face by developing a classification of RFID attacks, presenting their important features, and discussing possible countermeasures. The goal of the paper is to categorize the existing weaknesses of RFID communication so that a better understanding of RFID attacks can be achieved and subsequently more efficient and effective algorithms, techniques and procedures to combat these attacks may be developed."

    "abstract": "Denial of Service (DoS) attacks constitute one of the major threats and among the hardest security problems in todays Internet. Of particular concern are Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, whose impact can be proportionally severe. With little or no advance warning, a DDoS attack can easily exhaust the computing and communication resources of its victim within a short period of time. Because of the seriousness of the problem many defense mechanisms have been proposed to combat these attacks. This paper presents a structural approach to the DDoS problem by developing a classification of DDoS attacks and DDoS defense mechanisms. Furthermore, important features of each attack and defense system category are described and advantages and disadvantages of each proposed scheme are outlined. The goal of the paper is to place some order into the existing attack and defense mechanisms, so that a better understanding of DDoS attacks can be achieved and subsequently more efficient and effective algorithms, techniques and procedures to combat these attacks may be developed."
