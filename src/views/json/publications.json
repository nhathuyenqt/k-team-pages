            "abstract": "Denial of Service (DoS) attacks constitute one of the major threats and among the hardest security problems in todays Internet. Of particular concern are Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, whose impact can be proportionally severe. With little or no advance warning, a DDoS attack can easily exhaust the computing and communication resources of its victim within a short period of time. Because of the seriousness of the problem many defense mechanisms have been proposed to combat these attacks. This paper presents a structural approach to the DDoS problem by developing a classification of DDoS attacks and DDoS defense mechanisms. Furthermore, important features of each attack and defense system category are described and advantages and disadvantages of each proposed scheme are outlined. The goal of the paper is to place some order into the existing attack and defense mechanisms, so that a better understanding of DDoS attacks can be achieved and subsequently more efficient and effective algorithms, techniques and procedures to combat these attacks may be developed."

We prove that the maa fraud attack success using the Reid et al. protocol is bounded by and reduces as noise increases.

            "abstract": "Errors involving medication administration can be costly, both in financial and in human terms. Indeed, there is much potential for errors due to the complexity of the medication administration process. Nurses are often singled out as the only responsible of these errors because they are in charge of drug administration. Nevertheless, the interventions of every actor involved in the process and the system design itself contribute to errors (Wakefield et al. (1998) [23]). Proper inpatient medication safety systems can help to reduce such errors in hospitals. In this paper, we review in depth two recent proposals (Chien et al. (2010) [7]; HuangandKu(2009)[12])thatpursuetheaforementionedobjective.Unfortunately,theyfail in their attempt mainly due to their security faults but interesting ideas can be drawn from both. These security faults refer to impersonation and replay attacks that could produce the generation of a forged proof stating that certain medication was administered to an inpatient when it was not. We propose a leading-edge solution to enhance inpatient medication safety based on RFID technology that overcomes these weaknesses. Our solution, named Inpatient Safety RFID system (IS-RFID), takes into account the Information Technology (IT) infrastructure of a hospital and covers every phase of the drug administration process. From a practical perspective, our system can be easily integrated within hospital IT infrastructures, has a moderate cost, is very ease to use and deals with security aspects as a key point."

Often, to gain access to services/places, proving the physical proximity of a single device, may not be enough. Multiple wearable devices linked to function as a team may provide stronger guarantees on accurate authentication. Although distance-bounding (DB) protocols provide a reliable way to prove the physical proximity of a device and grouping-proof (GP) protocols can be employed to prove the presence of multiple provers, proving that multiple devices are present and in close proximity to a verifier is more challenging. In this letter, we introduce a new concept that extends traditional DB protocols to a multi-prover setting and we propose the first GPDB protocol that provides not only a proof of the presence of multiple provers at the same time but also assurance regarding the physical proximity of the provers, requiring limited computational effort. Furthermore, we discuss the effectiveness of this protocol, considering the main threats in DB and GP protocols"

            "abstract": "Many applications involve agents sharing a resource, such as networks or services. When agents are honest, the system functions well and there is a net profit. Unfortunately, some agents may be malicious, but it may be hard to detect them. We consider the decision making problem of how to permanently blacklist agents, in order to maximise expected profit. The problem of efficiently deciding which nodes to permanently blacklist has various applications ranging from efficient intrusion response, network management, shutting down malware infected hosts in an internal network and efficient distribution of services in a network. In this paper, we propose an approach to efficiently perform this blacklisting while minimising the cost of the service provider. Although our approach is quite general and could be applied to all the previously mentioned applications, to ease understanding we consider the problem in which an Internet service provider (ISP) needs to decide whether or not to blacklist a possibly misbehaving node.This is not trivial, as blacklisting may erroneously expel honest nodes (agents). Conversely, while we gain information by allowing a node to remain, we may incur a cost due to malicious behaviour. We present an efficient algorithm (HIPER) for making nearoptimal decisions for this problem. Additionally, we derive three algorithms by reducing the problem to a Markov decision process (MDP). Theoretically, we show that HIPER is nearoptimal. Experimentally, its performance is close to that of the full MDP solution, when the (stronger) requirements of the latter are met."

The answer is yes: under certain conditions on the prior, sampling from the posterior distribution can lead to a desired level of privacy and utility. For a uniform treatment, we define differential privacy over arbitrary data set metrics, outcome spaces and distribution families. This allows us to also deal with non-i.i.d or non-tabular data sets. We then prove bounds on the sensitivity of the posterior to the data, which delivers a measure of robustness. We also show how to use posterior sampling to provide differentially private responses to queries, within a decision-theoretic framework. Finally, we provide bounds on the utility of answers to queries and on the ability of an adversary to distinguish between data sets. The latter are complemented by a novel use of Le Cam’s method to obtain lower bounds on distinguishability. Our results hold for arbitrary metrics, including those for the common definition of differential privacy. For specific choices of the metric, we give a number of examples satisfying our assumptions"

Biometric credentials are becoming increasingly popular as a means of authenticating people due to the wide range of advantages that they provide with respect to classical authentication methods (e.g., password-based authentication). The most characteristic feature of this authentication method is the naturally strong bond between a user and her biometric credentials. This very same advantageous property, however, raises serious security and privacy concerns in case the biometric trait gets compromised. In this article, we present the most challenging issues that need to be taken into consideration when designing secure and privacypreserving biometric authentication protocols. More precisely, we describe the main threats against privacy-preserving biometric authentication systems and give directions on possible countermeasures in order to design secure and privacy-preserving biometric authentication protocols."

            "abstract": "Errors involving medication administration can be costly, both in financial and in human terms. Indeed, there is much potential for errors due to the complexity of the medication administration process. Nurses are often singled out as the only responsible of these errors because they are in charge of drug administration. Nevertheless, the interventions of every actor involved in the process and the system design itself contribute to errors (Wakefield et al. (1998) [23]). Proper inpatient medication safety systems can help to reduce such errors in hospitals. In this paper, we review in depth two recent proposals (Chien et al. (2010) [7]; HuangandKu(2009)[12])thatpursuetheaforementionedobjective.Unfortunately,theyfail in their attempt mainly due to their security faults but interesting ideas can be drawn from both. These security faults refer to impersonation and replay attacks that could produce the generation of a forged proof stating that certain medication was administered to an inpatient when it was not. We propose a leading-edge solution to enhance inpatient medication safety based on RFID technology that overcomes these weaknesses. Our solution, named Inpatient Safety RFID system (IS-RFID), takes into account the Information Technology (IT) infrastructure of a hospital and covers every phase of the drug administration process. From a practical perspective, our system can be easily integrated within hospital IT infrastructures, has a moderate cost, is very ease to use and deals with security aspects as a key point."
